    Objective: Analyze the sentiment of song lyrics and correlate it with song popularity and user engagement.
    Components:
        Data Extraction:
            Use the Spotify API to get track information and lyrics from a lyrics API.
        Data Processing:
            Implement a data pipeline using AWS Lambda for data extraction and AWS Glue for data transformation.
        Sentiment Analysis:
            Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of lyrics using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
        Data Visualization: 
            Create visualizations to show the correlation between sentiment, popularity, and user engagement.
    Tools: 
        Spotify API, 
        AWS Lambda, 
        AWS Glue, 
        NLTK/spaCy,
